description: Plan subtasks for the current objective
---
1. **CRITICAL: This is a PURE PLANNING step.** You are strictly FORBIDDEN from writing any code, creating files, or modifying any file other than `task.md`.
2. Create a plan to implement the features in `task.md`, following the rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
3. Do not modify existing, completed tasks.
4. Occasionally, some of the tasks would be pre-filled with numbered subtasks. Do not modify these pre-existing subtasks unless there are mistakes that should be corrected, but additional subtasks may be added to fully complete the task.
5. If the task calls for the creation of data formats, list the planned data format as code blocks within the subtask in `task.md`.
6. For new components or libraries, create a code block in `task.md` and list the name of its planned public and private methods, with comments describing its functionalities.
7. Do not include tests in the implementation.
8. In the same format, write the implementation plan back into `task.md`.
9. Leave all items as unchecked/incomplete.
10. **VERIFY: Ensure you have NOT modified any file other than `task.md`.** if you have, undo those changes immediately.
