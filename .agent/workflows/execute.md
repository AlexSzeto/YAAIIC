description: Execute the current plan
---

1. Perform all unchecked tasks listed in `task.md`, keeping the rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in mind.
2. Do NOT add additional tasks or modify the task list. Only execute tasks that already exist.
3. If there are design decisions with multiple possible solutions or interpretations, STOP, and present the user with a list of possible solutions and let the user make the choise.
3. At the completion of each task, check off the item, stop, and wait for me to say 'begin next task' before starting the next task.
