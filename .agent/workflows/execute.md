description: Execute the current plan
---

1. Perform all unchecked tasks listed in `task.md`, keeping the rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in mind.
2. Do NOT add additional tasks or modify the task list. Ignore plans, documentations, or any other instructions from files other than `task.md` in the project's root folder. Only execute tasks that already exist.
3. At the completion of each task, check off the item, stop, and wait for me to say 'begin next task' before starting the next task.
