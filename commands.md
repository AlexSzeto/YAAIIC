Create a plan to implement the features in `task.md`, following the rules from `rules.md`, and using previously implemented task examples from `task-history/` to understand how to expand a feature into tasks and expand each task into its implementation details. Occasionally, some of the tasks would be pre-filled with numbered subtasks. Do not modify these pre-existing subtasks unless there are mistakes that should be corrected, but additional subtasks may be added to fully complete the task. Do not include tests in the implementation. In the same format, write the implementation plan back into `task.md`. Leave all items as unchecked/incomplete. Do not update the code base.

Perform all unchecked tasks listed in `task.md`, keeping the rules from `rules.md` in mind. At the completion of each task, check off the item, stop, and wait for me to say 'continue' before starting the next task.

Prepare for the next set of tasks by creating a new `.md` file inside `task-history/` with an appropriately named filenam based on the title text inside `task.md`, similar to other existing completed tasks. The file should start with a number indicating the order the task was completed relative to the existing files. Copy the content of `task.md` verbatim into the newly created file inside `task-history/`, then delete everything in `task.md`, leaving it available to setup the next task.
