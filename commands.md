Create a plan to implement the features in `task.md`, following the rules from `rules.md`, and using previously implemented task examples from `task-history/` to understand how to expand a feature into tasks and expand each task into its implementation details. Occasionally, some of the tasks would be pre-filled with numbered subtasks. Do not modify these pre-existing subtasks unless there are mistakes that should be corrected, but additional subtasks may be added to fully complete the task. Do not include tests in the implementation. In the same format, write the implementation plan back into `task.md`. Leave all items as unchecked/incomplete. Do not update the code base.

Perform all unchecked tasks listed in `task.md`, keeping the rules from `rules.md` in mind. At the completion of each task, check off the item, stop, and wait for me to say 'continue' before starting the next task.
