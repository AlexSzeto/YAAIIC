Create a plan to implement the features in `task.md`, following the rules from `rules.md`, and using previously implemented task examples from `task-history/` to understand how to expand a feature into tasks and expand each task into its implementation details. In the same format, write the implementation plan back into `task.md`. Do not update the code base.

Perform all the unchecked tasks listed in `task.md`, keeping the rules from `rules.md` in mind. At the completion of each task, check off the item, stop, and wait for me to say 'continue' before starting the next task.
