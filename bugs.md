# Bug Fixes

## Fix Generated Image Display CSS Formatting
[x] Investigate the CSS styling issues with `generated-image-display` component:
1. Review the current CSS class structure in `public/css/style.css` and compare with the actual Preact component structure in `public/js/custom-ui/generated-image-display.js`.
2. Check if the CSS classes `.generated-image-container`, `.image-column`, `.info-column` are missing or incorrectly named.
3. The component should render with a proper two-column layout: image on the left, info fields vertically stacked on the right.
4. Inspect the recently deleted `generated-image-container` references to understand the expected CSS structure.
5. Add missing CSS classes or fix incorrect class names to restore the proper layout formatting.

[x] Fix the CSS class mapping between Preact component and stylesheet:
1. Ensure the `.generated-image-container` class exists and provides the proper flex layout for two columns.
2. Add or correct `.image-column` and `.info-column` classes for proper column styling.
3. Verify `.info-row`, `.info-input-container`, and `.info-buttons` classes are correctly styled for the field layout.
4. Test the component layout to ensure image and info fields are properly positioned and sized.

## Fix Generated Image Display CSS Formatting (Cont.)
[x] Fix copy and use button styling and positioning issues:
1. Examine the current button styling in the `GeneratedImageDisplayComponent` in `public/js/custom-ui/generated-image-display.js`.
2. Check if the buttons are using the correct CSS classes (`.copy-btn`, `.use-btn`, `.btn-with-icon`) and if these classes are properly defined.
3. Compare the button structure with gallery pagination buttons to identify the correct styling approach.
4. Investigate if the buttons need proper box-icon integration and sizing to match the design system.
5. Ensure buttons are properly positioned within the `.info-input-container` to the right of `.info-label` and above `.info-input-container`.

[x] Create reusable CSS style for single-icon buttons:
1. Extract common styling patterns from gallery pagination buttons and other single-icon buttons in the application.
2. Create a new reusable CSS class (e.g., `.btn-icon-only`) in `public/css/style.css` similar to `.btn-with-icon`.
3. Define consistent sizing, padding, border, background, and hover states for single-icon buttons.
4. Include proper box-icon sizing and positioning within the button container.
5. Apply the new class to copy/use buttons and any other single-icon buttons throughout the application.

[x] Update button styling to use the reusable icon button class:
1. Update the copy and use buttons in `GeneratedImageDisplayComponent` to use the new `.btn-icon-only` class.
2. Ensure proper button accessibility with appropriate ARIA labels and focus states.
3. Test button functionality and appearance across different field types (input vs textarea).
4. Verify button hover and active states work correctly and consistently with the design system.

## Fix pagination no longer available for Generated Image Display  
[] Investigate missing pagination in Generated Image Display:
1. Review the `CarouselDisplayComponent` in `public/js/custom-ui/carousel-display.js` to understand how pagination should be integrated.
2. Check if the pagination component is being properly instantiated and rendered within the carousel display.
3. Examine the relationship between `GeneratedImageDisplayComponent`, `CarouselDisplayComponent`, and the pagination system.
4. Verify that multiple images loaded through the gallery are being passed to the carousel/pagination system correctly.
5. Check if the pagination controls (prev/next buttons, current/total indicators) are being rendered in the DOM.

[] Debug carousel and pagination component integration:
1. Trace the data flow from gallery load → carousel data update → pagination component creation.
2. Verify that the `PaginationComponent` from `public/js/reusable-ui/pagination.js` is being properly imported and used.
3. Check if the pagination container element exists in the DOM and is properly styled/visible.
4. Ensure that `itemsPerPage` is set to 1 for single-item carousel navigation as specified in previous implementations.
5. Test the `updateDisplay()` callback to ensure current item data is properly passed to `GeneratedImageDisplayComponent`.

[] Restore pagination functionality for multiple generated images:
1. Fix any missing component instantiation or rendering issues in the carousel display.
2. Ensure the pagination component receives the complete `carouselData` array when multiple images are loaded.
3. Update the pagination controls to properly navigate between generated images.
4. Verify that the current image data updates correctly in `GeneratedImageDisplayComponent` when pagination changes.
5. Test the complete workflow: load multiple images from gallery → see pagination controls → navigate between images.

[] Verify pagination styling and positioning:
1. Ensure pagination controls are properly positioned relative to the generated image display.
2. Check that pagination styling matches the existing design system and carousel patterns.
3. Verify proper responsive behavior for pagination on different screen sizes.
4. Test accessibility features like keyboard navigation and ARIA labels for pagination controls.

## Fix Image Modal Display Issue
[x] Debug the image modal creation issue where no modal appears on screen:
1. Investigate the `createImageModal` function in `public/js/reusable-ui/modal.js` and verify proper modal instantiation.
2. Check if the `CustomModal` component is being rendered to the correct portal container in the DOM.
3. Verify that the modal's CSS styling is properly applied and the modal is not hidden by CSS properties.
4. Ensure the modal visibility state management is working correctly between Preact components.
5. Test the modal click handlers for both `GeneratedImageDisplayComponent` and gallery preview elements.

[x] Verify modal portal rendering and CSS application:
1. Confirm the portal container is correctly created and attached to document.body.
2. Check if modal CSS classes (`.image-modal-overlay`, `.image-modal-wrapper`, `.image-modal-container`) are properly applied.
3. Ensure proper z-index and positioning for modal visibility.
4. Test modal opening from both generated image display and gallery preview contexts.

## Fix Gallery Close Button Recursion Error
[] Resolve the infinite recursion error in `closeModal()` method:
1. Examine the `closeModal()` method in `public/js/reusable-ui/gallery.js` at lines 95-100.
2. Identify the cause of the recursive call where `closeModal` calls itself instead of the external callback.
3. Separate the internal modal close logic from the external `onClose` callback invocation.
4. Ensure proper event handler binding to prevent the recursion loop.
5. Test gallery close functionality through all close mechanisms (close button, overlay click, ESC key).

[] Implement proper separation of concerns for modal closing:
1. Create separate internal cleanup method for gallery state reset and component cleanup.
2. Ensure the external `onClose` callback is only called once without triggering internal recursion.
3. Update close button event handler to use the corrected close logic.
4. Verify the CustomModal component's close handling doesn't conflict with gallery's close logic.

## Remove Gallery Content Border
[] Remove redundant border from gallery content area:
1. Locate the `.gallery-content` CSS class in `public/css/style.css`.
2. Remove or comment out the border property since the container modal already provides a border.
3. Ensure the removal doesn't affect other styling aspects like padding or background.
4. Test the gallery appearance to confirm single border without double-border effect.

## Fix Gallery Preview Portrait Image Layout
[] Fix gallery previews to maintain aspect ratio while keeping text visible:
1. Examine the gallery preview CSS in `public/css/style.css` for `.gallery-preview` or similar classes.
2. Identify how portrait-oriented images are pushing text content below the visible frame.
3. Implement CSS solution to constrain image height while maintaining aspect ratio.
4. Ensure name and timestamp text remains visible within the preview container bounds.
5. Use CSS properties like `max-height`, `object-fit`, or flexbox to properly size image and text areas.

[] Test and refine the gallery preview layout:
1. Test with various image aspect ratios (portrait, landscape, square) to ensure consistent layout.
2. Verify text content (name and timestamp) always remains visible regardless of image orientation.
3. Maintain the square cropping behavior mentioned in previous task implementations while fixing text visibility.
4. Ensure the preview factory function in `gallery-preview.js` works correctly with the updated CSS.

## Fix Autocomplete Interaction Bug  
[] Research and resolve Preact/autocomplete.js interaction issue:
1. Investigate the interaction between Preact controlled components and the external autocomplete.js library.
2. Research solutions for integrating third-party DOM manipulation libraries with Preact controlled inputs.
3. Look for common patterns or solutions in the Preact community for handling external DOM libraries.
4. Consider using Preact refs to manage the textarea element that autocomplete.js modifies.

[] Implement solution for autocomplete text persistence:
1. Update the `WorkflowControlsComponent` in `public/js/custom-ui/workflow-controls.js` to properly handle autocomplete integration.
2. Ensure the textarea value is properly synchronized between autocomplete.js modifications and Preact state.
3. Use component lifecycle methods or refs to maintain autocomplete functionality without state conflicts.
4. Test the fix by typing partial text, accepting autocomplete suggestions, and then clicking generate/gallery buttons.

[] Validate autocomplete functionality integration:
1. Test the complete autocomplete workflow: type → autocomplete → accept → button click.
2. Ensure accepted autocomplete text persists in the textarea after button interactions.
3. Verify that Preact's controlled component pattern doesn't interfere with autocomplete.js DOM manipulation.
4. Test edge cases like multiple autocomplete sessions, backspacing, and manual text editing.
