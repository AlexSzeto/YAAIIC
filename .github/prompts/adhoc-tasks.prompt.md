NOTE: read the instructions from `windows-antigravity-fix.md` first if the current agent is being run through Antigravity on a Windows machine.
1. Wait for the user to describe the next task to be performed.
2. Plan out the implementation involved to complete the task, then record the steps as a new unfinished task in `task.md`, and place it before the first unfinished task remaining on the list of tasks under the section titled "Tasks".
3. Perform the newly added tasks in `task.md`, keeping the rules from `.github/rules.md` in mind.
4. At the completion of each task, check off the item, stop, and return to step one to prompt the user for the next task, repeating the planning and execution cycle.
