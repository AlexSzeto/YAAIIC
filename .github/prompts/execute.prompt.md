Perform all unchecked tasks listed in `task.md`, keeping the rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in mind. At the completion of each task, check off the item, stop, and wait for me to say 'continue' before starting the next task. If any task requires code change, I will request it instead of giving the 'continue' command. Whenever you need to implment fixes or modificationsbeyond the original scope of the task, add new numbered subtasks under the relevant task in `task.md` to document the additional work.
