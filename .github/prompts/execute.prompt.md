agent: edit
description: Execute the current plan
---
NOTE: read the instructions from `windows-antigravity-fix.md` first if the current agent is being run through Antigravity on a Windows machine.
Perform all unchecked tasks listed in `task.md`, keeping the rules from `.github/rules.md` in mind. At the completion of each task, check off the item, stop, and wait for me to say 'begin next task' before starting the next task. If any task requires code change, I will request it instead of giving the 'continue' command. For these instances of additional requests, add new numbered subtasks under the relevant task in `task.md` to document the additional work that is being done.
