Starting with a query that asks for a one sentence definition of the feature, ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for the next feature to implement. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.
