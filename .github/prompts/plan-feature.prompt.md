Starting with a query that asks for a one sentence definition of the feature, ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for the next feature to implement. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

This is a planning prompt. Do not update the code base. If you are confident in the spec, you can ask me to confirm that it's ready to be turned into tasks. If I confirm, follow the instructions from create-tasks.prompt.md to create a task list in task.md.
