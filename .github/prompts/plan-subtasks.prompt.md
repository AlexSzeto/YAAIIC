Create a plan to implement the features in `task.md`, following the rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Do not modify existing, completed tasks. If the task contains a notes section, use the notes as context for implementation details, but leave the notes themselves unchanged. Occasionally, some of the tasks would be pre-filled with numbered subtasks. Do not modify these pre-existing subtasks unless there are mistakes that should be corrected, but additional subtasks may be added to fully complete the task. If the task calls for the creation of data formats, list the planned data format as code blocks within the subtask. For new  components or libraries, create a code block and list the name of its planned public and private methods, wih comments describing its functionalities. Do not include tests in the implementation. In the same format, write the implementation plan back into `task.md`. Leave all items as unchecked/incomplete. Do not update the code base.
