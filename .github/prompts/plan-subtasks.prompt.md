Create a plan to implement the features in `task.md`, following the rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Occasionally, some of the tasks would be pre-filled with numbered subtasks. Do not modify these pre-existing subtasks unless there are mistakes that should be corrected, but additional subtasks may be added to fully complete the task. Do not include tests in the implementation. In the same format, write the implementation plan back into `task.md`. Leave all items as unchecked/incomplete. Do not update the code base.
