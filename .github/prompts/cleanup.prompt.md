Prepare for the next set of tasks by creating a new `.md` file inside `task-history/` with an appropriately named filename based on the title text inside `task.md`, similar to other existing completed tasks. The file should start with a number indicating the order the task was completed relative to the existing files. Copy the content of `task.md` verbatim into the newly created file inside `task-history/`, then delete everything in `task.md`, leaving it available to setup the next task.
