Now that we've wrapped up the brainstorming process, compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification in `task.md`. Do not modify existing, completed tasks. Follow the rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity between tasks. Make sure that each task builds on the previous tasks, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. For all testing, include instructions for manual tests only. Leave all items as unchecked/incomplete. Do not update the code base.
