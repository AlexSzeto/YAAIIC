agent: edit
description: Use the feature details derived from an existing conversation to create a series of tasks.
---
NOTE: read the instructions from `windows-antigravity-fix.md` first if the current agent is being run through Antigravity on a Windows machine.
Convert the written observations in `task.md` under the `Bugs and Design Flaws` section into a series of actionable tasks. Do not modify existing, completed tasks. Follow the rules from `.github/rules.md`. If the cause of an issue is unknown, investigate further to identify the problem and put down the fix as the task. Leave all items as unchecked/incomplete. After creating all tasks, reflect on the instructions that are missing from the current rules that caused these design and implementation issues to occur, and write a single paragraph of suggestion to improve the rules under the `Future Implementation Rules Suggestions` section. Do not update the code base.
