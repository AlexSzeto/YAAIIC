agent: edit
description: Use the feature details derived from an existing conversation to create a series of tasks.

NOTE: read the instructions from `windows-antigravity-fix.md` first if the current agent is being run through Antigravity on a Windows machine.
Now that we've wrapped up the brainstorming process, compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification in `task.md`. Do not modify existing, completed tasks. Follow the rules from `.github/rules.md`. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity between tasks. Make sure that the code created for each task is exposed through the existing UI for client side additions, or provide curls to test endpoints if the addition is server-side, creating temporary scaffolding if necessary. For all testing, include instructions for manual tests only. Leave all items as unchecked/incomplete. Do not update the code base.
