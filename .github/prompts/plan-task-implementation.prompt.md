Create a plan to implement the features in `task.md`, following the rules from `rules.md`, and using previously implemented task examples from `task-history/` to understand how to expand a feature into tasks and expand each task into its implementation details. In the same format, write the implementation plan back into `task.md`. Do not update the code base.
