Perform all unchecked tasks listed in `task.md`, keeping the rules from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in mind. At the completion of each task, check off the item. Stop and request the user to test and confirm if a task requires testing. Wait for the user to manually check off testing tasks, then wait for me to say 'begin next task' before starting the next task. Repeat this until all tasks are completed.
