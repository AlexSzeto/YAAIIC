# Execute inpaint workflow
[x] Modify the inpaint endpoint so that it would call `handleImageGeneration` after uploading the image files. Prepare the workflow data by sending `workflow`, `name`, `seed`, `prompt`, `imagePath` (currently being returned as `imageFilename`), `maskPath` (currently returned as `maskFilename`), and `inpaint` (always `true`). Do not send the `upload` data to the generation function.
   1. In `server.mjs`, locate the `/generate/inpaint` endpoint after the ComfyUI upload section
   2. Add workflow lookup logic similar to the `/generate/txt2img` endpoint to find the workflow configuration by name
   3. Generate random seed if not provided in the request, matching the txt2img endpoint pattern
   4. Create storage path for the generated inpaint result image using `findNextIndex` function
   5. Prepare the request body with `imagePath` and `maskPath` using the uploaded filenames from ComfyUI upload results
   6. Set `inpaint: true` flag in the request body to identify this as an inpaint operation
   7. Remove the `uploads` data from the request body before calling `handleImageGeneration`
   8. Call `handleImageGeneration(req, res, workflowData)` with the prepared request and workflow configuration
   9. Remove the current success response return since `handleImageGeneration` will handle the response

[x] Modify `handleImageGeneration` from `generate.mjs` to accomodate for inpaint workflows. Ensure that the extra parameter `inpaint` is stored in `image-data.json` and added to the return data.
   1. Update the function to accept and handle `imagePath` and `maskPath` parameters from `req.body`
   2. Add `inpaint` flag parameter handling from `req.body` (boolean value)
   3. Include `imagePath` and `maskPath` in the workflow modifications processing alongside existing parameters
   4. Modify the `imageDataEntry` object creation to include the `inpaint` flag field
   5. Update the JSON response data to include the `inpaint` flag in the returned data object
   6. Ensure proper logging of inpaint-specific parameters for debugging purposes 

[x] Modify `inpaint.mjs` to process the inpaint result.
   1. On the server side, add `uid` to the returned data on a successful image generation.
   2. On the client side, on a successful inpaint, refresh the interface by updating the `uid` from the return data to change the query parameter in the URL. internally refresh the rest of the page by repopulating the form with the new image data.

[x] Send `inpaintArea` to the `inpaint` endpoint as a JSON object, and pass it to the image generation workflow. Store the result in `image-data.json`, pass the result back to the client, and update the client code to update the inpaint area prop in the inpaint canvas on page load or page data refresh.
   1. Modify the client-side inpaint form submission in `inpaint.mjs` to include the `inpaintArea` data from the canvas component
   2. Update the `/generate/inpaint` endpoint in `server.mjs` to accept and validate the `inpaintArea` parameter from the request body
   3. Pass the `inpaintArea` data to `handleImageGeneration` function along with other workflow parameters
   4. Update the `imageDataEntry` object creation to store the `inpaintArea` data in the database record
   5. Include `inpaintArea` in the JSON response data returned to the client
   6. Modify the inpaint canvas component to accept and apply `inpaintArea` data as a prop during initialization
   7. Update the page data refresh logic in `inpaint.mjs` to pass the returned `inpaintArea` to the canvas component
   8. Ensure the inpaint area is properly restored when loading existing inpaint results or refreshing the page
