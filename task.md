# Image to Video

## Goal
Add server and UI support for image to video workflows.

[] (Server) Hard code two workflow parameters, `frames` (set to 21), and `framerate` (set to 20) to be replaced later.
[] (Server) Add support for the workflow replace parameter `saveFilename` (which extracts the filename portion of `savePath`, without the folder path or the extension) and `storagePath` (the absolute system path to the project's `/storage` folder)
[] (Server) Add support for the `extractOutputPathFromTextFile` parameter, which opens the specified filename (located inside the project's `/storage` folder), and retrieve the full path to the file generated by the workflow. It would then copy the file generated into the originally intended `savePath` before proceeding with the text generation steps (if any).
[] (Server, Client) Rename the workflow type `txt2img` as `image`, and update all related static references to the label.
[] (Client) Add support for `type: "video"` on the client UI. Treat the workflow identically to image workflows except to enable two more number form values between the existing `Name` and `Seed` fields: `Length` (in seconds, sent to the server as `frames`, which is `length*framerate`), and `Frame Rate` (sent to the server as `framerate`)
