# ComfyUI Task Progress Support
[] Establish a webhook connection between client and server for tracking image generation execution progress
[] Modify the comfyi UI prompt execution flow on the server side to track the completion percentage through a websocket connection. Create a webhook response format for generation in progress and a slightly modified response for completed tasks, containing all of the information in the current synchronous response.
[] Render the progress sent by the webhook to the client as an asynchronous, persistent banner at the top of the page. For this iteration, periodically update the name of the task that the server is perorming and the completion percentage. When the task completes fully, execute the code that's currently connected to the synchronous response from the server. Create a shared progress bar component and a library for managing webhooks on the client side so the same code can be reused on the inpaint page as well as the index page.
